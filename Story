Once upon a time, in a forest, there lived a Monkey who resided on a berry tree, which was on the banks of a river. In the same forest, there lived a crocodile and his wife who were enemies with the Monkey. The crocodiles were enemies with the Monkey because the Monkey always stole the crocodiles food! Every time that the crocodiles went to get their food, the Monkey stole it away.
